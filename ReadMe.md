# Photo location changer
## Here is the image positioning modifier used by "JetCar", now we have v2.0.0
### The usage is very simple.
1. When you start it, it will pop up two windows:
1.1 Your original picture folder (it is recommended that you back up an original copy)
1.2 Your new save location (no folder creation service, but may be created in the menu)

2. Two windows are opened. One is a square that expresses the original coordinates, expressed in red; the other is a window with buttons. On the left is your changed picture and some selection buttons.
PS: When you press "Click to save", you will not be reminded on the window. You can see "Image saved" on the console.
"Click to back photo" means going back to the previous picture

3. When you complete the modification, press "Click to Exit" or press "Esc" on the keyboard to exit.
