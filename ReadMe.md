# Photo Location Changer
## Here is the image positioning modifier used by "JetCar", now we have v2.0.0
### The usage is very simple.

1. **Start the application**:
   - When you start it, it will pop up two windows:
     - **Original Picture Folder**: This is where your original pictures are located. It is recommended that you back up an original copy.
     - **New Save Location**: This is where your modified pictures will be saved. No folder creation service is provided, but you may create folders manually if needed.

2. **Two windows are opened**:
   - **Original Coordinates Window**: This is a square that expresses the original coordinates, represented in red.
   - **Button Window**: This window contains buttons on the left side. It displays your changed picture and some selection buttons.

3. **Saving and Navigating**:
   - **Click to Save**: When you press this button, you will not be reminded on the window. However, you can see "Image saved" on the console.
   - **Click to Back Photo**: This button allows you to go back to the previous picture.

4. **Exiting the Application**:
   - When you complete the modification, press "Click to Exit" or press "Esc" on the keyboard to exit.
